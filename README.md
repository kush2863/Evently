This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
The Soroban-stellar Project is in the Stellar Branch.. I have Tried multiple attempts to implement Frieghter Wallet using its packages and try different Resources too
The code Has no errors but when i am calling the Frieghter wallet,their is an issue with the Extension as i my browser is prompting User has wallet connected or user has give access but it isnt connecting with the Functions provided In the documentation... I have followed step by step given in the documentations plus refered the github repo nothing worked.
Barboros Suggested that i write this thing in readme and Submit my project....
The original idea was that i conncent my project with the wallet for transactions...
You can check my live project at this link 
https://collegeconnect1.vercel.app/
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
