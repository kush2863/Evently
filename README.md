# Idea
## A platform where college societies can post their future events happening in their college so a fast and better publicity plus it can also accomodates inter college events too saving them a lot of time and efforts for publicity

For Aptos-navigate to aptos branch 
##clone it
## npm install

## I have implement a smart contract to push the created Event to the aptos blockchain.. 
## You can check the sources folder for the contract
## Navigate to components>Shared>EventForm.tsx and you will the transaction code that integrates my smart contract to frontend using aptos Typescript SDK...
## also tried to implement the wallet adaptor but there was issue with the Node Modules of the waller adapter, i have implemented that too but commented out it was giving troubles to the project
